Project Title: Diabetes Prediction with Streamlit Deployment

Description:

This project tackles the challenge of predicting diabetes using machine learning. We built a robust model pipeline that incorporates data cleaning, balancing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive analysis using various models.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Thorough data cleaning, including handling missing values and outliers, for reliable modeling.
Data Balancing: Effective measures to address class imbalances and ensure model fairness.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Deep understanding of the data through visualizations and statistical analysis to uncover patterns and relationships relevant to diabetes prediction.
Predictive Modeling: Implementation of seven different machine learning algorithms to compare and select the most suitable for diabetes prediction.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimization of model hyperparameters for improved performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.97.
Experiment Tracking with MLflow: Efficient model experimentation management, enabling easy comparison and reproducibility.
Streamlit Web App: User-friendly interface for interactive testing and demonstration of the model.
CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions: Automated deployment of the model on Streamlit Cloud, streamlining the transition from development to production.
Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn (or other chosen ML libraries)
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
MLflow (for experiment tracking)
Streamlit (for web app creation)
GitHub Actions (for CI/CD pipeline)

Running the Project:

Clone the Repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/diabetes-prediction.git
Use code with caution.

Install Dependencies:

Bash
cd diabetes-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.

Explore Notebooks (Optional):

Open the Jupyter notebooks in this directory to replicate the data cleaning, EDA, model training, and hyperparameter tuning stages.

Run Streamlit Web App:

Bash
streamlit run app.py
Use code with caution.

This will launch the Streamlit web app, allowing you to interact with the model.

Deployment (Streamlit Cloud):

This section provides detailed instructions on deploying the project to your Streamlit Cloud account (replace placeholders with your actual information).

Set up a Streamlit Cloud account (if you haven't already).
Create a new app in Streamlit Cloud.
Push the code to your GitHub repository.
Configure your GitHub Actions workflow by creating a .github/workflows directory and adding a YAML file that specifies the deployment steps. Reference the Streamlit Cloud deployment action (streamlit/actions-deploy@v1) and provide your streamlit_cloud_url and a GitHub secret named STREAMLIT_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN (generated from your Streamlit Cloud account settings).
On push to your main branch, GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the CI/CD pipeline, deploying your Streamlit app to Streamlit Cloud.
